## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
rm(list=ls()) 
library(tidyverse)
library(jsonlite)
library(gdata)
library(dplyr)
library(ggrepel)
library(ggplot2)
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}

#fetching URL and making dataframe

url <- "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/2021/12/20/us-coronavirus-deaths-2021/ff0adde21623e111d8ce103fedecf7ffc7906264/scatter.json"
df <- fromJSON(url)
```

```{r}

```

```{r}

#plotting with "geom_repel", so that the names of the states are more tidy plotted

df %>%
ggplot(aes(x=fully_vaccinated_pct_of_pop, y=deaths_per_100k))+
  geom_point(alpha=0.5, color = "green")+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(by = 10)) +
  geom_text_repel(aes(label=name), size=2)+
  labs(title = "Covid-19 deaths compared with vaccination rates", y="Avg montly deaths per 100 000", x= "Share of population fully vaccinated")+
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent)+
  annotate("segment", x=0.76, y=9, xend=0.77, yend=8, arrow=arrow(length = unit(0.3, "cm")), color="red")+
  annotate("text",x = 0.73, y = 9.5,label = "Higher vaccination rate, lower death rate",color = "red",size = 1.8,)+
    annotate("segment", x=0.56, y=17, xend=0.54, yend=18, arrow=arrow(length = unit(0.3, "cm")), color="red")+
    annotate("text",x = 0.56, y = 16.8,label = "Lower vaccination rate, higher death rate",color = "red",size = 1.8,)
```

```{r}
lm(deaths_per_100k ~ fully_vaccinated_pct_of_pop, data=df)

```

```{r}
#The intercept value i get tells me that when the "fully vaccinated percentage of population" is at 0, the deaths per 100k would have a mean of 31.15. This is likely not very meaningful, as there is no states that have a 0% vaccination rate. The coefficient for vaccinated percentage of population is -36.66. This tells me that there is a negative correlation, and that if the vaccination percentage was to increase with 1%, the deaths per 100k would be expected to decrease with 36.66.

#plotting with geom_smooth of the linear model

df %>%
ggplot(aes(x=fully_vaccinated_pct_of_pop, y=deaths_per_100k))+
  geom_point(alpha=0.5, color = "green")+
  geom_smooth(method=lm)+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(by = 10)) +
  geom_text_repel(aes(label=name), size=2)+
  labs(title = "Covid-19 deaths compared with vaccination rates", y="Avg montly deaths per 100 000", x= "Share of population fully vaccinated")+
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent)+
  annotate("segment", x=0.76, y=9, xend=0.77, yend=8, arrow=arrow(length = unit(0.3, "cm")), color="red")+
  annotate("text",x = 0.73, y = 9.5,label = "Higher vaccination rate, lower death rate",color = "red",size = 1.8,)+
    annotate("segment", x=0.56, y=17, xend=0.54, yend=18, arrow=arrow(length = unit(0.3, "cm")), color="red")+
    annotate("text",x = 0.56, y = 16.8,label = "Lower vaccination rate, higher death rate",color = "red",size = 1.8,)
